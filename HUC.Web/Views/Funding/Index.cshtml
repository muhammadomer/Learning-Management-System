                        Training Courses are dedicated to helping Law firms address the latest SRA Regulations. We understand that economically times
                        are still tough for most of us. As such we are constantly looking for funding avenues from governing bodies and private
                        organisations alike so that we can pass on funding solutions to those individuals and companies who are dedicated to progressing
                        with their professional development.

                        Below are some of the funding solutions currently available through HUC. We expect this section to grow and grow so please feel
                        free to check back regularly for future funding solutions.

                        The Government has been running a scheme for a while whose aim is to drive growth in the SME sector. It has often been referred to
                        as "One of their best kept secrets!"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The scheme offers companies, which meet the application criteria, the chance to access funded training, use of business coaches
                        and attendance at a series of six half day workshops.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In our opinion this is an outstanding offering and has the potential to make a substantial difference to the growth prospects of
                        small businesses and our economy as a whole.
                    </p>
